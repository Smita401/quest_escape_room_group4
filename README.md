**DEV**

- Make a new live share file
    The Game
    Deliver a main.ipynb file with your Python game solution and the .py file(s) containing your functions. It should reflect the Python concepts learned each day and be pushed to GitHub. You may download the files from the Google Colab and push these. The end product
  should be fully functional but also well-structured, efficient, robust, and entertaining!

- Make google slide for the game
    Title Slide (1 slide): your project's name & your names
    Project Overview (1-2 slides):
    How is the game's structure organized?
    Which functions do you have and how are they imported?
    Which features did you add to the game?
    Technical Challenge (1-2 slides):
    What was the most important technical challenge you faced?
    How did you overcome that challenge?
    Big Mistake (1-2 slides):
    What was the biggest mistake you made during this project?
    What did you learn from it?
    Demo Slide (1 slide): literally says "DEMO" with a link to your project so you can open it easily
    Closing Slide (1 slide): your project's name, your name & a "Thank You"
    _Total: 6-8 slides


- Start constructing your own game structures.
    Create main.ipynb and copy the code from sample-code.ipynb. Expand the code following the example to create Bedroom 1.
    Test the game with Game Room and Bedroom 1. Make sure everything works and then work on Bedroom 2, and then the Living Room.
    Test the whole game. Try to make all kinds of inputs to make sure your game is rock solid and will not break.


**Research**
-Interpreting Python errors

    Review the day's lectures to reinforce your understanding of Python data structures and flow control.
    You may create a document with the key points of research carried out to present to the Dev Team if you wish.



**DAY 1 MEET**

**DEV**
1. explain the game after running the code
2. show what have been coded

**RESEARCH**
1. share the python error message understanding
2. recal the day lecture which relate to the game code

**END DAY 1**
Edit the code based on research and dev recommendation solve the errors if any.






**DAY 2**

**DEV**

- Flowchart for the game decision: https://www.canva.com/design/DAF-FBDo0lM/zdIIvMdwtJ7hdRXjfkdEyQ/edit?utm_content=DA[…]m_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton
  
- Defined the name and type  in each level
  
- Add repo to github for the code
  
  
**RESEARCH**
- self-guided
  
    Hints for developing functions :
    Define functions to handle different game actions. For example, you can create a function explore_level(level) to display the level description and available actions. This function can take the current level as an argument and retrieve its details from the game_state dictionary.
    Implement functions to handle specific actions, such as examine_food(food) to provide information about a specific food in the level, unlock_tunnel(tunnel) to unlock a tunnel if the player ate the « eatable » food, and go_to_next_level(level) to move the player to the next level if the tunnel is unlocked.
    Function 1: explore_level1(level1)
    Function2 : examine_food(food)
    Function3: unlock_tunnel1(tunnel1)
    Function4: go_to_next_level(level2)
    
    Some coding good practices to apply to our game code:
    #Pep 8 Style Guide (Python style guide) :
    
    Indentation: Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
    Line Length: Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
    Blank Lines: Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.
    Imports: Always put import statements at the top of the file. They should be on separate lines.
    Naming conventions: Follow specific naming conventions such as using lowercase letters with words separated by underscores for functions, variables, and modules.
    Whitespaces: Use spaces around operators and after commas to improve code clarity. Avoid unnecessary whitespace within parentheses or brackets.
    #Write readable code
    
    Use Descriptive Names: Variable, function, and class names should be descriptive and use the snake_case naming style. Avoid using single-letter variable names, unless in very short block codes where the variable has no real meaning.
    Use Comments Wisely: While it's important to comment your code, don't overdo it. Comments should explain why something is done, not what is done. Python code should be self-explanatory.
    Stay Consistent: If you choose a way to do something, stick with it. Consistency makes your code easier to read and understand.
    #Document functions using the "docstrings"
